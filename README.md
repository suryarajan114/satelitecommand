Satellite Command System Programming Exercise
Problem Statement
You are tasked with developing a Satellite Command System that simulates controlling a satellite in orbit. The satellite starts in a default
initial state and can accept a series of commands to change its orientation, solar panel status, and data collection.
Functional Requirements
1. Initialize the Satellite: Create a class or function that initializes the satellite's attributes to their initial state.
2. Rotate: Implement a command called 'rotate' that takes a direction parameter (North, South, East, West) and sets the satellite's
orientation accordingly.
Example: rotate(North) would set the orientation to "North".
3. Activate/Deactivate Solar Panels: Implement commands called 'activatePanels' and 'deactivatePanels' to control the solar panels'
status.
Example: activatePanels() would set the solar panels to "Active".
4. Collect Data: Implement a command called 'collectData' that increments the 'Data Collected' attribute by 10 units, but only if the solar
panels are "Active".
Example: collectData() would set the data collected to 10 if the solar panels are "Active".
Initial State
Your satellite begins with the following attributes:
Orientation: "North"
Solar Panels: "Inactive"
Data Collected: 0
Commands to be executed
The series of commands should be executed in a sequential manner over the initial state, altering the satellite's state accordingly. You could
execute them through function calls, or simulate a command-line interface where these commands can be entered.
For example:
rotate(South)
activatePanels()
collectData()
After these commands, the satellite's state would be:
Orientation: "South"
Solar Panels: "Active"
Data Collected: 10
Evaluation Criteria
1. Code Quality: Utilization of best practices, SOLID principles, and design patterns is highly encouraged.
2. Functionality: Does your implementation correctly execute the commands and maintain the satellite's state?
3. Global Convention: Your code should be easily understandable and maintainable.
4. Gold Standards: Logging, exception-handling, and transient error-handling mechanisms should be implemented.
5. Code Walkthrough: Be prepared to explain your decisions, design patterns used, and the overall architecture during a code review.
6. he intent behind the 'Satellite Command System' coding exercise is to evaluate a candidate's ability to design and implement a system that
manages state transitions and dependencies between various components... The challenge provides a realistic yet simplified simulation of
what engineers might encounter in fields like aerospace technology or complex system management.
This question not only assesses the technical skills and coding abilities of the candidates but also their understanding of design patterns,
state management, and system design principles. The task requires them to employ SOLID principles and various design patterns, which
are crucial for writing maintainable, scalable, and robust software. It also allows candidates to demonstrate their expertise in command
execution, error handling, and loggingâ€”all of which are highly relevant in real-world applications...
